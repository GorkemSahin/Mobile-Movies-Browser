# 24i-RN-Assignment
A React Native application I developed based on the assignment I was given by 24i.

# How to run
Install dependencies via
`npx npm install`
Build using
`npx react-native run-ios`
or
`npx react-native run-android`
Alternatively you can browse the /ios or /android folders using Xcode or Android Studio and build from there.
